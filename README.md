There are 2 releases, one is for regular osu!mania accuracy and the other one is for Scorev2 even though quaver is pretty much scoreV2 it's very slightly different.

it's all written in Python. I have the code cause I made it but I'm not very good at programming so a little embarrassing. If you finds any issues with it, please let me know.
